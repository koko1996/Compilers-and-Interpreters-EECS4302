// Declare one variable `p` that is uninitialized, 
// `q` and `r` are initialized (fixed) to some values.
// This means that when verifying formulas involving `p`,
// both true and false must be considered.
// But for `q` and `r`, only the initialized, fixed values are considered.  
var q = false
var r = true
var p

verify p
verify q
verify r

// implications
verify not p or q <=> p => q
verify p or q <=> p => q
verify p and q <=> p => q

// weakening/strengthening
verify p and q => p or q
verify p or q => p and q
verify p and q <=> p or q

// misc
verify p and q and r
verify p or q or r
verify p => q => r
verify p <=> q <=> r
